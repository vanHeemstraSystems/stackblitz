# 100 - Import from GitHub

You can run any public GitHub repository on StackBlitz by adding the username and repo name to the URL like so:

stackblitz.com/github/{GH_USERNAME}/{REPO_NAME}

For example, opening up the repository you are currently reading: https://stackblitz.com/github/vanHeemstraSystems/stackblitz

**WARNING**: StackBlitz expects at least a ```package.json``` to be in the root of the repository you are visiting. Should you not have a package.json file in the root of your repository, create one with ```npm init``` before opening the repository with stackblitz.
