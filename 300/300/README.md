# 300 - Using StackBlitz on your site

If you’re writing a blog, maintaining a documentation site or an open source project, you can use StackBlitz to:

1. [Embed examples and demos](https://developer.stackblitz.com/guides/integration/embedding) on your page or in your blog posts.
2. [Add “Open in StackBlitz” buttons](https://developer.stackblitz.com/guides/integration/open-from-github) to your READMEs and docs.
3. [Generate custom projects on the fly](https://developer.stackblitz.com/guides/integration/create-with-sdk) with our JavaScript SDK.
4. [Use StackBlitz reproductions in GitHub](https://developer.stackblitz.com/guides/integration/bug-reproductions) bug issue templates!

Happy coding!
